# Feature Specification: Detailed Analysis Progress Bars

**Feature Branch**: `001-analysis-progress-bars`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "utiliza spec-kit para agregar una barra de avance para las diferente etapas del analisis"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**As a** music analyst using the Music Analyzer Pro application  
**I want** to see detailed progress information for each stage of audio analysis  
**So that** I can understand what processing is happening and estimate time remaining accurately

### Key Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Single File Analysis Progress
```
Given: User selects a single audio file for analysis
When: Analysis begins
Then: User sees progress bars showing:
  - Overall progress (1 of N files)
  - Current file analysis stages:
    * Audio loading (0-10%)
    * BPM detection (10-40%) 
    * Key detection (40-70%)
    * Energy calculation (70-85%)
    * HAMMS vector computation (85-100%)
  - Stage name and estimated time remaining
```

#### Scenario 2: Batch Analysis Progress
```
Given: User selects a directory with multiple audio files
When: Batch analysis begins  
Then: User sees:
  - File-level progress bar (File X of Y)
  - Current file name being processed
  - Stage-level progress for current file
  - Overall time elapsed and estimated remaining
  - Ability to cancel at any stage
```

#### Scenario 3: Error Handling During Stages
```
Given: Analysis encounters error during a specific stage
When: Error occurs (e.g., corrupted audio file)
Then: Progress bar shows:
  - Error indicator on the failed stage
  - Option to skip file and continue
  - Detailed error message in log
  - Overall progress continues with next file
```

## Functional Requirements

### Core Progress Tracking Requirements
1. **Stage Visibility**: System must display the current analysis stage name clearly
2. **Stage Progress**: Each analysis stage must show percentage completion (0-100%)
3. **Time Estimation**: System must provide estimated time remaining for current stage and overall process
4. **Visual Feedback**: Progress bars must update smoothly without blocking the UI
5. **Cancellation Support**: User can cancel analysis at any stage with immediate response

### Progress Bar Components  
1. **Overall Progress**: Shows total files processed vs. remaining
2. **Current File Progress**: Shows progress within the current audio file analysis
3. **Stage Progress**: Shows progress within the current analysis stage
4. **Status Text**: Displays current stage name and file being processed

### Analysis Stages to Track
1. **Audio Loading**: File reading and format validation
2. **BPM Detection**: Beat tracking and tempo analysis  
3. **Key Detection**: Musical key and pitch class analysis
4. **Energy Calculation**: RMS energy and dynamic range analysis
5. **HAMMS Computation**: Harmonic feature vector generation
6. **Database Storage**: Saving results to SQLite database

### Performance Requirements
1. **Responsiveness**: Progress updates must not lag more than 250ms behind actual progress
2. **Accuracy**: Stage progress must accurately reflect actual computation progress
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Progress tracking must not significantly increase memory usage

## Key Entities

### AnalysisProgress
- `file_count_total`: Total number of files to analyze
- `file_count_current`: Current file being processed (1-based)
- `current_filename`: Name of file being processed
- `overall_progress`: Overall percentage (0.0-1.0)
- `stage_name`: Current analysis stage name
- `stage_progress`: Stage-specific percentage (0.0-1.0)
- `time_elapsed`: Total time elapsed in seconds
- `time_remaining`: Estimated time remaining in seconds

### AnalysisStage
- `name`: Human-readable stage name
- `weight`: Relative computational weight for time estimation
- `progress_callback`: Function to report stage progress

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

1. **Empty Files**: Show appropriate error state for zero-byte files
2. **Corrupted Audio**: Handle decoder failures gracefully with clear error messages
3. **Very Long Files**: Ensure progress tracking works for files > 10 minutes
4. **Network Storage**: Handle slow file access without blocking progress updates
5. **Insufficient Memory**: Graceful degradation when analysis cannot complete

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] User can see which analysis stage is currently running
- [ ] Progress bars show accurate completion percentages
- [ ] Time estimates are reasonably accurate (within 30% after first file)
- [ ] User can cancel analysis during any stage
- [ ] Error states are clearly communicated

### Should Have  
- [ ] Smooth progress bar animations (no jumpy updates)
- [ ] Stage completion times logged for future estimation improvements
- [ ] Progress persists briefly after completion before next file

### Could Have
- [ ] Historical analysis time data for better estimates
- [ ] Progress sound notifications (optional)
- [ ] Detailed performance metrics per stage

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] **User-focused**: Specification describes what users will experience, not implementation details
- [ ] **Testable**: Each requirement can be verified through UI testing or automated tests  
- [ ] **Complete**: All user scenarios are covered with clear expected behaviors
- [ ] **Unambiguous**: No vague terms or assumptions that could be interpreted multiple ways
- [ ] **Feasible**: Requirements align with existing application architecture
- [ ] **Business value**: Feature clearly improves user experience during analysis tasks
- [ ] **Error handling**: Edge cases and failure scenarios are explicitly defined
- [ ] **Performance**: Non-functional requirements (response time, memory) are specified

## Notes

- This specification focuses on enhancing the existing single-threaded analysis workflow
- Progress tracking should integrate with the current AnalyzeWorker thread implementation  
- Visual design details intentionally omitted - will be addressed in planning phase
- Stage weights and time estimation algorithms will be refined based on empirical testing
