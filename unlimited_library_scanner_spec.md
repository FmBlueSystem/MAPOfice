# Unlimited Library Scanner with Persistent Storage - Specification

## 📋 Executive Summary

### What
Implementation of unlimited recursive music library scanning with persistent SQLite storage, eliminating the 1000-track limitation and providing intelligent caching to avoid re-analysis of existing tracks.

### Why
Current system limitation of 1000 tracks is insufficient for large music libraries (10,000+ tracks). Need persistent storage to maintain analysis results across application restarts and provide efficient incremental scanning.

## 🎯 Core Requirements

### R1: Unlimited Recursive Scanning
- **WHAT**: Remove all artificial limits on track scanning
- **WHY**: User libraries contain 10,000+ audio files
- **VALIDATION**: System must scan entire library regardless of size
- **EDGE CASES**: Handle extremely large libraries (50K+ files) without memory issues

### R2: Persistent Storage System
- **WHAT**: SQLite database to store all analysis results permanently
- **WHY**: Avoid re-analyzing tracks on each application launch
- **VALIDATION**: Database must survive application restarts
- **PERFORMANCE**: Sub-second query times for 10K+ track libraries

### R3: Intelligent Caching
- **WHAT**: Track file modification times to detect changes
- **WHY**: Only re-analyze files that have actually changed
- **VALIDATION**: Modified files get re-analyzed, unchanged files use cache
- **EFFICIENCY**: 99% cache hit rate for subsequent scans

### R4: Incremental Scanning
- **WHAT**: Scan only new/modified files in subsequent runs
- **WHY**: Full library rescans are time-prohibitive for large collections
- **VALIDATION**: New files detected and analyzed automatically
- **PERFORMANCE**: Incremental scans complete in <1 minute for typical changes

## 📊 Data Completeness Requirements

### Input Validation Rules
- **Library Path**: Must exist and be readable
- **Audio Files**: Support .mp3, .flac, .wav, .m4a, .aac, .ogg extensions
- **File Integrity**: Skip corrupted or inaccessible files without crashing
- **Modification Time**: Track file system timestamps accurately

### Data Quality Standards
- **BPM Analysis**: Required for playlist generation compatibility
- **Genre Classification**: Maintain existing BMAD genre compatibility matrix
- **Metadata Extraction**: Title, Artist, Album when available
- **HAMMS Vectors**: 12-dimensional harmonic analysis for similarity

### Failure Scenarios
- **Corrupted Files**: Log error, continue scanning
- **Permission Denied**: Log warning, skip file
- **Disk Full**: Graceful degradation, notify user
- **Database Corruption**: Auto-backup and recovery mechanisms

## 🔄 Integration Requirements

### UI Integration
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress for unlimited scans
- **Statistics Display**: Show database statistics (total tracks, cache hits)
- **Scan Modes**: Full scan vs. incremental scan options
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking UI during large scans

### Playlist Generation Integration
- **Database Queries**: Efficient track selection from database
- **BMAD Compatibility**: Maintain existing quality certification
- **Performance**: Sub-second playlist generation for 10K+ libraries
- **Filtering**: Advanced filters for genre, BPM range, energy level

### Performance Requirements
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for any library size
- **Scan Speed**: >50 tracks/second on modern hardware
- **Database Size**: <100MB for 10K track library
- **Query Performance**: <100ms for complex queries

## 🛡️ Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Data Completeness Validation
- ✅ All discovered audio files have database entries
- ✅ File modification times tracked accurately
- ✅ No duplicate entries for same file path
- ✅ Orphaned records cleaned up for deleted files

### Gate 2: Performance Validation
- ✅ Unlimited library scan completes successfully
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable during large scans
- ✅ Database queries perform within time limits
- ✅ UI remains responsive during background scanning

### Gate 3: Integration Validation
- ✅ Existing playlist generation works with database
- ✅ BMAD quality metrics preserved
- ✅ UI statistics accurately reflect database state
- ✅ Export functionality works with database tracks

### Gate 4: Reliability Validation
- ✅ System handles scan interruption gracefully
- ✅ Database integrity maintained across restarts
- ✅ Incremental scans detect all changes correctly
- ✅ Error handling prevents data corruption

## 🎵 Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- **Unlimited Scanning**: Successfully scan libraries of 10K+ tracks
- **Cache Efficiency**: >95% cache hit rate on subsequent scans
- **Performance**: Complete incremental scans in <2 minutes
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss across application restarts

### User Experience Metrics
- **Responsiveness**: UI remains interactive during scans
- **Transparency**: Clear progress indication for long operations
- **Efficiency**: No need to wait for re-analysis of existing tracks
- **Flexibility**: Choose between full and incremental scan modes

## 🔍 Non-Functional Requirements

### Scalability
- Support libraries up to 100,000 tracks
- Linear performance scaling with library size
- Efficient memory usage regardless of library size

### Reliability
- Database backup and recovery mechanisms
- Graceful handling of interrupted scans
- Data integrity validation and repair

### Maintainability
- Clear separation between scanning and storage layers
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Database schema versioning for future upgrades

### Security
- No exposure of file system paths outside application
- Safe handling of special characters in file names
- Protection against SQL injection in database queries

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing BMAD CLI
- Database must be SQLite for simplicity and portability
- No external dependencies beyond existing project requirements
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing PyQt6 UI

### Architecture Decisions
- Single SQLite database file for all track data
- File hash-based deduplication to handle duplicates
- Asynchronous scanning with progress callbacks
- Lazy loading of database results for memory efficiency

This specification ensures the implementation will handle unlimited library sizes while maintaining the BMAD quality standards and providing excellent user experience.
