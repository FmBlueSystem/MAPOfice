## Skill Gap Analysis

### Current Team Skills
- ✅ Python development
- ✅ API integration
- ✅ Testing frameworks
- ⚠️ Factory pattern implementation
- ⚠️ Performance profiling
- ❌ BMAD framework expertise

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Factory Pattern Training**: 2-hour workshop before Day 3
2. **Performance Profiling**: Bring in consultant for Day 8
3. **BMAD Framework**: Review existing documentation, pair programming

## Backup Resources

### Primary Backups
- **Lead Developer Backup**: Senior Developer (cross-trained)
- **Senior Developer Backup**: Mid-level Developer from Team B
- **QA Engineer Backup**: QA Automation Engineer
- **DevOps Backup**: Platform Engineer

### Escalation Path
1. Team Lead → Project Manager
2. Project Manager → Department Head
3. Department Head → Executive Sponsor

## Resource Costs

### Internal Resources
| Role | Daily Rate | Days | Total Cost |
|------|------------|------|------------|
| Lead Developer | $800 | 4 | $3,200 |
| Senior Developer | $700 | 3 | $2,100 |
| DevOps Engineer | $650 | 2.5 | $1,625 |

- Pair programming for complex implementations
- Documentation as you go approach
- Recorded sessions for future reference

### Efficiency Improvements
1. **Automated Testing**: Reduces QA effort by 40%
2. **Code Generation**: Templates for repetitive patterns
3. **Reusable Components**: From existing implementations
4. **CI/CD Automation**: Reduces deployment time by 60%

## Risk Mitigation

### Resource Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Key person unavailable | Medium | High | Cross-training, documentation |
| Skill gaps | Low | Medium | Training, external support |
| Resource conflicts | Medium | Medium | Clear priorities, escalation |
| Burnout | Low | High | Reasonable hours, rotation |

### Contingency Plans
1. **10% Time Buffer**: Built into estimates
2. **Flexible Scope**: P2 features can be deferred
3. **External Support**: Pre-approved budget for consultants
4. **Weekend Work**: Optional with compensation

## Communication Plan
