# POML Specification: MAP4 Duplication Elimination

```yaml
specification:
  title: "MAP4 Duplicate Process Consolidation"
  version: "1.0"
  methodology: "spec-kit + POML + BMAD"
  priority: "CRITICAL"
  
problem_statement: |
  MAP4 project contains 6 duplicate CLI interfaces, 7 duplicate LLM providers,
  20+ scattered test files, and 5+ fragmented BMAD implementations causing:
  - 3x slower development velocity
  - Exponential maintenance overhead  
  - High bug risk from configuration conflicts
  - Inconsistent user experience across entry points

success_criteria:
  technical:
    - 70% reduction in duplicate files
    - Single unified CLI entry point
    - Factory pattern for LLM provider management
    - Consolidated test suite with clear boundaries
    - Unified BMAD methodology implementation
  process:
    - 2x improvement in development velocity
    - 60% reduction in configuration bugs
    - 24-hour onboarding for new developers
    - Automated duplication detection in CI/CD

constraints:
  - Zero feature regression during consolidation
  - Maintain >95% test coverage throughout refactoring
  - Preserve existing API compatibility where possible
  - Complete consolidation within 2-week sprint
```

```yaml
execution_sequence:
  1. architecture_design_agent:
     - reads: 01-spec-kit-specification.md
     - creates: unified_cli_architecture.md, provider_factory_design.md
     
  2. measurement_agent:
     - reads: duplication analysis results
     - creates: current_state_metrics.md, baseline_measurements.md
     
  3. analysis_agent:
     - reads: architecture + metrics
     - creates: implementation_plan.md, risk_assessment.md
     
  4. implementation_agent:
