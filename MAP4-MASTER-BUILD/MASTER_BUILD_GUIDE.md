## 📊 Validation Checkpoints

### After Phase 1 (Foundation)
```python
# Test environment setup
python -c "import librosa, PyQt6, sqlalchemy, click; print('All core packages installed')"

# Test project structure
ls -la src/ tests/ data/ config/
```

### After Phase 2 (Core System)
```python
# Test HAMMS engine
python -m src.analysis.hamms_v3
# Expected: "HAMMS v3.0 initialized successfully"

# Test GUI launch
python -m src.ui.enhanced_main_window
# Expected: Main window appears

# Test CLI
map4 --version
# Expected: "MAP4 v1.0.0"
```

### After Phase 3 (Evolution)
```python
# Test batch processing
map4 analyze batch /path/to/music --workers 4
# Expected: Processes at 400+ tracks/minute

# Test export
map4 export pdf --tracks 100 --output report.pdf
# Expected: PDF generated in <5 seconds

# Test search
map4 search "electronic" --bpm 120-130
# Expected: Results in <100ms
```

### After Phase 4 (Production)
```bash
# Run complete test suite
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Check performance benchmarks
python scripts/benchmark.py

# Validate Docker build
docker build -t map4:latest .
docker run --rm map4:latest map4 --version
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Import Errors
```bash
# Solution: Ensure PYTHONPATH is set
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/src"
```

#### Issue 2: LLM Provider Failures
```bash
# Solution: Check API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```

#### Issue 3: Audio Processing Errors
```bash
# Solution: Install system dependencies
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libsndfile1

# macOS:
brew install ffmpeg libsndfile
```

#### Issue 4: Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Solution: Initialize database
python -m alembic init alembic
python -m alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial"
python -m alembic upgrade head
```
