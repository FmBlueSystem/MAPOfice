## How to Use Meta-Prompts

### 1. Configuration-Driven Generation
Each meta-prompt uses a YAML configuration system that allows you to customize the generated application:

```yaml
# Example configuration for music analysis application
APPLICATION_CONFIG:
  name: "Studio Analyzer Pro"
  focus: "PRODUCTION"
  complexity: "ADVANCED"
  vector_dimensions: 24

ANALYSIS_FEATURES:
  harmonic_analysis: true
  rhythmic_analysis: true
  semantic_analysis: true

AUDIO_PROCESSING:
  primary_library: "essentia"
  sample_rate: 48000
  quality_gates: true
```

### 2. Template Variables and Conditional Logic
Meta-prompts use template variables and conditional blocks:

```yaml
{#if INCLUDE_HARMONIC}
- **Harmonic Analysis**: BPM detection, key signature identification
{/if}

{APP_NAME} = "Your Application Name"
{COMPLEXITY} = "PROFESSIONAL"
```

### 3. Generated Output Structure
Each meta-prompt generates:
- Complete implementation code
- Project structure recommendations
- Configuration templates
- Dependencies and requirements
- Usage examples and validation criteria

## Integration Patterns

### Combining Multiple Meta-Prompts
Many applications benefit from combining patterns:

**Music Analysis + Multi-LLM + PyQt6**:
```yaml
# Create a comprehensive music analysis application
music_analysis:
  vector_dimensions: 12
  ai_enrichment: true

llm_integration:
  providers: ["openai", "anthropic"]
  fallback_strategy: "COST_OPTIMIZED"

gui_framework:
  framework: "PyQt6"
  theme_system: true
  real_time_updates: true
```

**CLI-GUI + Architecture + Audio Processing**:
```yaml
# Create a professional audio processing tool
architecture:
  pattern: "LAYERED"
  service_layer: true

interfaces:
  cli_framework: "click"
  gui_framework: "PyQt6"

audio_pipeline:
  primary_library: "librosa"
  batch_processing: true
```
