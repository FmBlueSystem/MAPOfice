# POML + BMAD Review Mission: Reverse Engineering System Enhancement

## üéØ Mission Objective
Conduct comprehensive review of the MAP4 Reverse Engineering System using Microsoft POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language) and BMAD (Build-Measure-Analyze-Decide) methodologies to identify improvement opportunities.

## üìã Review Scope

### POML Analysis Areas
1. **Prompt Orchestration Quality**
   - Sequential prompt dependencies and flow
   - Conditional logic and branching effectiveness
   - Parameter passing and state management
   - Error handling and fallback strategies

2. **Markup Language Standards**  
   - YAML/JSON structure optimization
   - Template parameterization effectiveness
   - Documentation markup consistency
   - Meta-prompt generation efficiency

3. **Orchestration Patterns**
   - Agent coordination and workflow management
   - Task decomposition and parallel execution
   - Resource allocation and optimization
   - Quality gates and validation checkpoints

### BMAD Methodology Review
1. **Build Phase Assessment**
   - Architecture design completeness
   - Component specification accuracy
   - Integration pattern effectiveness
   - Scalability considerations

2. **Measure Phase Evaluation**
   - Metrics definition and collection
   - Baseline establishment accuracy
   - Performance measurement completeness
   - Quality indicator effectiveness

3. **Analyze Phase Review**
   - Data analysis thoroughness
   - Pattern recognition accuracy
   - Gap identification completeness
   - Improvement opportunity assessment

4. **Decide Phase Validation**
   - Decision criteria clarity
   - Implementation roadmap completeness
   - Risk assessment accuracy
   - Success criteria definition
